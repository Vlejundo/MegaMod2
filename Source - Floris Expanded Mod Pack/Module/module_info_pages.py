 ("troop_tree","Troop Tree","The troop tree is the backbone for each faction: it is the way soldiers are trained. And of course we all know that better soldiers mean the difference between victory and rotting in a cell deep in Khudan. Each faction has its own troop tree, showing the way they train their men. It is thus important to understand the thought behind these trees, the 'philosophy of troop trees'.^^When you look at the different trees, they might seem large and intimidating. But rest assured: there is a logic behind it. It all rests on three basic principles: 1. it takes a lot of time and money to train really good soldiers, 2. soldiers are people who can choose to specialise, or to widen their view, and 3. each faction has their own kind of training methods. Let's have a closer look at those three points.^^The first principle says that it takes a lot of time and money to train the best soldiers you could wish for. In Mount & Blade: Warband this is already reflected in the levels. To get a level 30 knight you'd need to train your recruit for quite a long time. The money this training costs, on the other hand, isn't that well reflected. Yes, the better a unit is, the higher the upkeep, but that's a fact ones a part of the training is completed. To get there, you need to pay for upgrades. Your better soldier needs better equipment, and training also costs a lot. These high training costs are here reflected in many upgrades you'll have to make before you have the best soldiers possible. To go from recruit to the best unit, you'll need to pay six times upgrade costs. Each step along the way I call a 'tier'. This means that each troop tree has seven 'tiers', with the first being the recruit and the last, the so-called 'top-tier unit', being the best soldier possible. So those many steps from beginning till end you see in the troop tree are actually that long training your soldier recieves in his life in your service.^^The second principle says that soldiers are people too, with their own wishes and carreer prospects. Of course, if you want to become the best possible archer in history, you'll need to train for a very long time. But what if you started the training, but discover you really don't like staying behind to shoot people: you'd rather run towards the enemy and slaughter them face to face. You could stop your archery training and start a new one, learning how to handle a sword. Of course you won't be as good as someone who had started his sword training right from the start, but you have other skills too, from your archery training. These possibilities and choices life offers, are in the troop trees reflected by the width of the tree. You could start with a certain training, but it is possible to do something completely different along the way.^^The third principle says that each faction has its own kind of training methods. In the troop trees that means that each faction has different kinds of top-tier units, and has different kinds of weaponry. Let's have a look at each of the factions:^^Swadia. Based on both England and France, they have specialized in their knights and longbows. This is reflected in the long training the recruits receive in both polearms and bows. Their pikemen aren't as well trained as their knights: most of them step upon a horse and continue to ride their lances, instead of walking with them. Also there are soldiers who wield the two-handed claymores. They are better than those pikemen, but not as good as the knights or longbowmen.^^Vaegir. Based on the early Russians, they too have specialised in strong knights. But they have learned a trick or two from the Khergit, since they can not only wield bows well too, but also mount them. Their weakness lies in footsoldiers with one-handed weapons, be it hammers or swords.^^Khergit. The Mongols of Calradia. They live and die on their horses, so it's no suprise that both their top-tier units are mounted. Early on they specialise in one-handed swords or bows.^^Nord. Based on Scandinavia and the old Vikings. They are the opposite of the Khergit: you won't find any mounted troops with the Nords. Instead they train with spears and axes, and master the art of throwing them too. There are some Nord archers, but they are considered the lowest kind of soldiers.^^Rhodok. Based on several Italian city states, such as Venice and Genoa. Like the Nord they don't have many horses in their ranks. They compensate that by training hard with their one-handed swords and a wide spectrum of different crossbows. Also they have some heavy spear training.^^Sarranid. Based on the Ottman and Egypt Islamic Empires, they know their way around with scimitars. Just like the Khergit they know how to mount archers, but they also learned to train some really heavy knights. Their uniqueness lies in their maces.^^Mercenaries. Based on the Holy Roman Empire. As a faction without land, they are for sale to anyone. Their training is not as extensive as the other factions, but their unique weaponry make them a good alternative to fill your ranks: from Swiss pikemen and German zweihanders to Teutonic knights and even crossbowmen.^^Women. Never underestimate a woman, especially those from the Holy Roman Empire. These women are like mercenaries, but with other weaponry. Bows, hammers and one-handed swords are their choices on the field.^^As you can see, the different factions all have their strengths and weaknesses, while some even heave weapons in their arsenal you won't find elsewhere. This is exactly what I meant when I said that each faction has his own training methods.^^I hope you can now understand why the troop trees are so extensive. You won't be just upgrading your units to better soldiers: you will give them a training to your liking, creating a truly unique army. You'll have to think about your men's training, giving the game an entire new dimension."),

You gain the opportunity to hire a chamberlain when you get your first village, a constable when you gain your first castle, and a chancellor when you gain your first town.  If you dismiss one of your employees, you may be able to rehire them through a well-connected spouse or one of the travellers who frequent the taverns of Calradia.^^Aside from these the mod has other features as well, which can be accessed from the Camp menu.^^This mod uses Diplomacy Version "+DPLMC_DIPLOMACY_VERSION_STRING+"."),
("dplmc_autoloot", "Autoloot", "Autoloot settings are managed through the camp menu.  It allows you to have your companions (named heroes, not ordinary soldiers) automatically select equipment from the loot after a battle.  In order for this feature to be enabled, one of the following must be true: someone in your party must have a Looting score of 2 or better, someone in your party must have an Inventory Management score of 3 or better, or the player himself must have an Inventory Management score of 2 or better."),
("dplmc_autosell", "Autosell", "The Autosell feature allows you to sell many items to a merchant all at once, instead of selling them one at a time.  Autosell settings are managed through the Town menu, where you can specify which types of items you want to be able to sell (e.g. you might not want to automatically sell horses) and a price limit (for example, you might not want to automatically sell any items that cost more than 200 denars).^^ There are two primary ways to use autosell.  If you speak to a Horse Merchant, Armorer, or Weapon Merchant in a town, there is a conversation option to sell items of a particular type.  Also, when visiting a town there will be an option in the Marketplace section of the menu to automatically sell your items throughout the town.^^ For people who used Autosell in other mods, note that this sells from your own inventory, according to certain rules.  Items you have equipped will never be sold, and neither will the first three items in your inventory.  After that, autosell also skips anything that it thinks might be your personal equipment (since people often have more than one set).  Regardless of whether you have them equipped, it won't sell your best bow, crossbow, armor, helmet, boots, or gloves.  If you have a bow you can use, it won't sell your best three packs of arrows, and if you have a crossbow it won't sell your best three packs of bolts.  For shields, one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons, polearms, and horses, it won't sell your best or second-best item.  Your best three throwing weapons also will not be sold.  However, items that your character is unable to use are considered fair game."),

 ("morale", "Morale", "Morale represents the ability and willingness of the troops in a party to summon up the endurance, bravery, and discipline they need to face the stresses of battle and the march. It is not the same thing as the troops' happiness. Elite troops may grumble and whine about the hardships of campaigning -- but then stand together as one when the arrows start to fly. On the other hand, a commander who gives his men everything they want may find that they grow soft, and waiver before the enemy's charge.^^ Morale's greatest impact is on a party's behavior in battle, determining how aggressively troops engage the enemy, and how likely they are to break and run if they perceive the tide of battle turning against them. Morale also affects a party's march speed, as a less motivated party will move more slowly, as the men are not pushing themselves to their physical limit, and pause more frequently, as it waits for stragglers to catch up. Finally, a party with very low morale will start to suffer desertions.^^ Some factors that affect morale are intuitive. For example, a charismatic commander with a reputation for winning battles can infuse his or her men with a sense of confidence. Leaders who give their men well ample and varied supplies of food, and pay them on time, demonstrate that they care about their troops' welfare, and are less likely to lead them into disaster.^^ Other factors are less intuitive -- particularly those related to a party's sense of group cohesion. In a small tight-knit party, for example, men will often fight hard against daunting odds to avoid showing cowardice before their comrades-in-arms. A large party on the other hand may see its cohesion strained, as the commander has less time to supervise the men, listen to their grievances, and resolve their disputes. Frequent battles will strengthen the bonds between men, while long periods without combat will see the troops become bored and quarrelsome.^^ The morale report, accessibly by hitting the 'reports' button will give the player a sense of the factors affecting his or her men's morale."),
 ("economy", "Economy", "Towns and villages in Calradia need a wide variety of goods for their populations to remain healthy and productive. First in importance is food. Grain is the staple crop of Calradia, but people also need fat and protein in the form of meat, fish, or cheese. It takes almost as much work to preserve meat as to produce it in the first place, so salt is also in high demand. After food comes clothing: heavy wool, lighter linens, or luxurious velvet. Finally, people need the tools of their trade: ironware, pottery, leatherware, and, of course, arms, armor, and horses for war.^^Most agricultural products are produced in the villages, while artisans in the towns specialize in manufactured or artisanal goods like fabrics or ironware. Also, different resources can be found in different parts of the country. Consequently, the key to prosperity in Calradia is trade -- both between the villages and the towns, and between the major towns themselves.^^When trade flows, goods will be available and affordable, the population of a center will be healthy and energetic, and migrants will flock from the nearby regions. The center will produce more, consume more, and be able to contribute more in taxes to their lords. When trade dries up, towns and villages will see their workers flee to seek work elsewhere, and economic activity will drift to a stand-still. Thus, it is in the interests of rulers to protect trade routes from the hazards of war and banditry. A smart merchant, however, may want to seek out towns which have become isolated from the rest of the land, as he or she may be able to turn a tidy profit from the resulting price imbalances.^^Because villagers usually plan to take their goods to market in towns, village markets will be rather quiet places, and villagers will buy cheap and sell dear. Serious merchants will stick to the towns to make a profit, although some parties may decide to make a quick stop in a village to acquire supplies.^^A player who wants to know about the factors affecting a region's prosperity can speak to the guildmaster of the local town. Other information can be gleaned from passers-by, although they might not know very much outside of their own particular trade."),
 ("courtship", "Courtship", "Players may wish to marry into one of Calradia's noble families. Marriage is not necessary for a player to rise in power and stature, but it does provide players with an opportunity to improve their relation with lords and establish a claim to the throne.^^Marriage requirements will be different for males and females. A male character will usually need to pursue a traditional path of courtship. He should establish a reputation in Calradian aristocratic society, get on good terms with his bride's parents or guardians, and then woo the lady according to local custom. If a player grows impatient, he may attempt to take a shortcut -- but there will be consequences in his relations with other lords.^^A male character should keep in mind that other lords will be competing with him for the affections of the kingdom's ladies. Also, a lady's tastes are unpredictable, and a player may also find that the object of his love does not love him in return. Romance, in Calradia as elsewhere, does not always prosper. Of course, a player may resort to other, less gentlemanly means of winning a lady's heart, but again, that will have a serious impact on his reputation.^^To get started on the path of courtship, a male player should try to get involved in the social life of the Calradian aristocracy, attending feasts and tournaments. Also, wandering troubadours and poets can serve as a useful repository of information on courtship, and keep the player up to date about the latest gossip.^^Female characters can also marry -- but they should keep in mind that Calradian society is very traditional, and, as adventurers, they have chosen a very unconventional path for a woman. A female character may have to look for a while to find a lord who is open-minded enough to marry her.^^On the bright side, a female character does not have to go through the elaborate rituals of courtship, and she also may gain more from a marriage than her male counterpart. For a woman adventurer, marriage can be a quick path to power -- and an unscrupulous character may be able to use her husband as a tool of her political ambitions."),
 ("politics", "Politics", "The realms of Calradia, although they represent different cultures, all adhere to the same basic political system: feudalism. Feudalism is based on the relationships between individuals: the oaths of loyalty given by a vassal to his or her liege. In exchange for this oath, the vassal will usually receive a fief, a parcel of land whose income will be used by the vassal to raise troops to support the liege in time of war. A liege also has an obligation to protect his vassals, and to treat them justly.^^This is how it works in theory, anyway. In practice, vassals will not always work in their factions' interests, particular as they are often quarreling with one another. Nobles have different personalities, and sometimes those personalities clash. Or, perhaps two nobles were once friends, but fell out over in the aftermath of a setback or a defeat -- or because they both were wooing the same lady. Jealousies will also surface as they vie for the favor of the king -- perhaps over newly conquered lands, or over who will be given the coveted office of marshal, the lord in charge of organizing large-scale campaigns.^^When one realm in Calradia makes war on another, the political unity of the each kingdom is as important as the quality or number of its soldiers in determining the outcome. In a cohesive kingdom, nobles will join together in a large force to sweep their opponents before them. In a kingdom divided by petty quarrels, lords will fail to respond to the marshal's summons, or drift away to attend to their own business if a campaign is not going well. A faction's political cohesion will also impact warfare when campaigns are not in progress. In a divided faction, lords will be less likely to join together on raids and patrols, and come to each other's defense.^^If it seems self-defeating for nobles to bicker and quarrel when the enemy is just over the horizon, keep this in mind -- ultimately, a noble's loyalty goes not to a particular faction or culture, but to himself and to his family. If a noble fears that his faction is collapsing, or if he is being neglected by his liege, he can usually find a reason to withdraw his oath of allegiance, and change sides. Players should keep this in mind, as they may find that there are opportunities to turn discontented former enemies into allies."),
 ("character_backgrounds", "Character_Backgrounds", "A player character in Calradia may choose to come from a variety of social backgrounds. This choice will affect not just his or her starting skills and equipment, but also the course of his or her career as an adventurer.^^War and politics in Calradia are traditionally dominated by male aristocrats. A nobleman player character may find that he is invited into this 'old boys' club' fairly quickly, but women and commoners may face a few extra hurdles on the way. If you choose to start the game as a male nobleman, you can think of it as the 'easy' setting. Starting as a noblewoman or a male commoner is somewhat more difficult, and starting as a female commoner is probably the most challenging way to begin a game.^^However, women have some starting advantages. Simply by taking up arms, a female warrior will draw attention to herself, and she may find that she can build up her reputation faster than a male. Also, it is traditionally easier for a woman to marry up the social ladder than it is for a man, and a woman may find she can gain more from a strategic marital alliance than her male counterpart.^^Finally, keep in mind that the game does not place any limits on the upward mobility of characters based on their background. Noble or common, male or female, married or unmarried -- anyone can rise to become ruler of all Calradia, if they are sufficiently brave, lucky, or resourceful."),
 ("military_campaigns", "Military Campaigns", "When kingdoms in Calradia go to war, their armies have two basic offensive options. They can try to attack villages and lay waste to the countryside, damaging their enemy's prestige and economy. Or, they can try to seize and hold castles or towns, taking territory This second option can involve long, bloody sieges, but will yield more decisive results.^^It is important to note that the realms of Calradia do not field standing armies, which remain in the field as long as the ruler desires. Rather, Calradian realms are protected by feudal levies comprised of the major nobles and their individual retinues. Sometimes, these nobles launch their own private attacks into enemy territory, but the most decisive events will usually take place when the great hosts are assembled. The kingdom's marshal, a noble appointed by the king, will summon the host before the campaign and lead them out to battle. However, he should be careful not to keep them in the field too long. Otherwise, the host will begin to disintegrate, as the vassals drift off to pursue their own business, and the army will be vulnerable to a counter-attack.^^For this reason, the rhythm of wars in Calradia often resemble the rhythm of a duel between two individual combatants. One side will gather its strength and seek to land a blow against the enemy's territory. If the marshal spends too little time gathering the vassals, he may not be able to do any real damage. If he spends too much time, then the campaign may end before it has even begun. A large realm will have an advantage over a smaller one, just as a brawny combatant has an edge over a smaller foe, but a realm's political cohesion can also be a factor, just as a fighter with great stamina can outlast her opponent. Sometimes, the armies of two realms will meet head on, resulting in a major battle in which both numbers and morale will decide the outcome.^^Sovereignties will have imperfect intelligence about their enemies. Attacking lords will need to frequently scout enemy territory to determine which fortresses may be vulnerable. An army defending its homeland will benefit from the alarms raised by castles and towns, which broadcast intelligence about enemy movements in the area. Such intelligence will be imprecise, however, particularly when it comes to numbers. A defending force which sets out to raise a siege or rescue a village may be able to overwhelm an unprepared attacker -- or it may miscalculate, and find that it is the one to be overwhelmed. Attackers, in turn, must be careful how far they advance into enemy territory, with aggressive marshals venturing further than cautious ones.^^Players will be expected to join in their faction's military campaign, either by joining the host, or by scouting ahead into enemy territory. Some players may find that their realm's marshal is too cautious, or too aggressive, for their tastes. In this case, they can intrigue with other lords to try to replace the marshal, or build support to become the marshal themselves.^^Most wars are of limited duration. A king who goes to war will, for the sake of honor, feel obligated to pursue the conflict for a short while. However, unless he is soundly beating his enemy. He may soon start looking for a way out of the conflict, lest he leave himself vulnerable to an attack by a third party. Calradia's rulers are keenly aware that today's ally may be tomorrow's enemy, and vice versa."),

# Jrider + TITLES v0.0 titles descriptions
 ("nobility_titles", "Nobility Titles",
"Titles vary from kingdom to kingdom the most common interpretation is:^\
King (ruler): ^  Rex, King, Velikiy Knyaz, Khan, Konungr, Doge, Sultan^^\
Duke (lord of a town): ^\
A duke is, historically, of highest rank below the monarch, and historically controlling a duchy. The title comes from the Latin Dux Bellorum, a term that ancient Roman chroniclers used to describe tribal Germanic and Celtic war leaders.^\
In the Middle Ages the title signified first among the Germanic monarchies. Dukes were the rulers of the provinces and the superiors of the counts in the cities and later, in the feudal monarchies, the highest-ranking peers of the king.^\
  Dux, Duke, Knyaz, Wang, Hertogi, Patrizio, Mushir^^\
Earl/Count (lord of a castle): ^\
Earl was the Anglo-Saxon form and jarl the Scandinavian form of a title meaning \"chieftain\" and referring especially to chieftains set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced with duke (hertig/hertug); in later medieval Britain, it became the equivalent of the continental count.^\
  Comes, Count, Boyar, Noyan, Jarl, Conte, Quadi^^\
Baron (lord of a village): ^\
The word baron comes from Old French baron, itself from Old High German and Latin (liber) baro meaning \"(free) man, (free) warrior\"; it merged with cognate Old English beorn meaning \"nobleman\".^\
  Baro, Baron, Posadnik, Darga, Hersir, Barone, Sheik^^\
Lord (landless noble): ^\
The etymology of the word can be traced back to the Old English word 'hlaford' which originated from 'hlafweard' meaning 'bread keeper' or 'loaf-ward', reflecting the Germanic tribal custom of a chieftain providing food for his followers.^\
  Dominus, Lord, Dvorianin, Taishi, Heera, Signore, Sayyid^^\
The female equivalents are (whether they own the land themselves or hold the title from their husband's):^\
Queen: ^  Regina, Queen, Velikiy Knyaginya, Khathun, Drottning, Dogaressa, Sultana^^\
Duchess: ^  Ducessa, Duchess, Knyaginya, Wathun, Hertogafru, Patrizia, Mushira^^\
Countess: ^  Comitessa, Countess, Boiaryna, Nohi, Greifynja, Contessa, Qadiya^^\
Baroness: ^  Baronessa, Baroness, Posadnitsa, Darthun, Baronsfru, Baronessa, Sheika^^\
Lady: ^  Domina, Lady, Dvorianska, Behi, Fru, Signora, Sayyida^^\
In addition unmarried, landless daugthers (or sisters) are named as follow:^\
  Magistra, Mistress, Mestari, Gongzhu, Mesterinde, Padrona, Maulana^^\
The titles come from Latin, English, Russian, Mongol (or chinese), Old Norse (or mid-norwegian), Italian and Arabic.^^\
Mongol titles should have the name placed before the title (not the case here for sorting considerations in the notes), female equivalents for the title were unavailable for most of the titles and were made up.^^\
Companions currently in the party are titled Palatinus.^\
The members of the Imperial Guard were named after Palatine Hill, the mythical founding place of Rome. On the same hill lived the members of the older of two schools of the ancient Salii brotherhood of God of War Mars, which had some symbolism in common with that of the imperial palace. Military training schools were the scholae, and the Imperial Guard was called Scholae Palatinae.^It was a personal army that the emperor was allowed to use personally on campaigns.^^\
Other companions who are not vassals are titled as Hero if they don't have any specialty, otherwise:^\
  Missi : best suited for diplomacy.^\
  Tassein : has a good knowledge of tactical related skills, including engineering and training.\
  Ausculare : a master of scouting through the use of tracking, spotting and path-finding.^\
  Fisique : inclined toward the healing arts of surgery, first aid and wound treatment.^\
  Empori : goods management, either through trade, looting or foraging."),

 ("entrenchment","Camp Entrenchment", "  When your army sets up camp for the night, you are given the option to entrench your camp site. An entrenched camp site is a temporarily fortified position using terrain and pickets as a defensive barrier. Armies composed mostly of cavalry units will get little benefit from entrenching. Armies comprised mostly of foot soldiers will find that entrenchment will give them a significant advantage over cavalry units. Soldiers very much dislike digging holes and planting pickets, so you will suffer a small morale penalty when choosing this option.^^ If you choose not to entrench your camp site, you will be at a disadvantage if attacked while camping. Your camp may be over run and plundered. Items in your inventory may be looted or destroyed in the battle. An entrenchment that has not been over run recieves the benefit of multiple ammunition reloads for the troops. A normal camp site gets no such benefit.^^  In order to entrench your position you will need tools, time, and skill. Tools can be purchased at many of the towns in Calradia, and one set must be in your inventory in order to entrench. The time required to entrench is based upon the number of soldiers in your army and your parties skill in engineering. A small band of warriors with no skill in engineering will take days to entrench a camp site. An army of 30 or more with a few points in engineering can accomplish this in just a few hours.^^ When you complete the entrenchment, a circle of pickets will surround your camp. This entrenchment will remain in place for approximately three days after leaving the entrenchment. You can leave and return to the entrenchment during this time without having to do any more digging or planting of pickets, thus avoiding any morale penalty. This makes an entrenched site an excellant base of operations for sieges or incursions into enemy territory."),
